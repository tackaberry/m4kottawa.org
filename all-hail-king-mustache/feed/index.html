		<description><![CDATA[Big congrats to the organizers!  I felt that the night went perfectly.  The events were great, the set-up was great, the staches were great, everything was great!  There is little room for improvement if you ask me.  Let&#039;s just make it bigger and hairier next year, and we&#039;ll be set!  Big props to Mike Hollingworth for his well deserved victory.  I couldn&#039;t see his mustache dancing myself, as I was standing behind him, but I hear that his crazy tongue action clinched it for him.  I didn&#039;t realize that the judges were looking for X-rated moves, but now that I know, the Polish stache will be a force to be reconned with in 2007.  Enjoy your reign while it lasts Hollingworth!  Next year it&#039;s no holds barred!  Good job everyone!
