<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-11.58.04-PM1.png"><img class="wp-image-394 size-medium alignright" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-11.58.04-PM1-224x300.png" alt="" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-11.58.04-PM1-224x300.png 224w, https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-11.58.04-PM1-764x1024.png 764w, https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-11.58.04-PM1.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a></h3>
<p>Hayden is a beautiful 5 year old boy with severe epilepsy. When we visited him he told us right away that he wanted to “see Pluto on a big boat!” Hayden’s wish was our command, and we sent him on a Disney Cruise Line®.</p>
<p>He a fantastic time. Hayden loved playing in Andy’s Room (based on the Toy Story character) and in the Oceaneer’s club. He was thrilled to find out that he could get ice cream all day. He danced on the Castaway Cay island and met Mickey Mouse. But the moment he was waiting for was the chance to meet Pluto.</p>
<p>“The look on his face when he met Pluto for the first time made me cry,” Hayden’s mom told us. “The sheer joy on his face was the definite highlight of the wish trip.”</p>
<p>His family thanked us for making Hayden’s dreams come true, and also thanked WestJet for “all of the wonderful help they gave our family to make travelling easier.”</p>

She is a very active young girl and loves to swim, play volleyball, and dance. Her most cherished wish was to go to Walt Disney World® Resort with her family.</p>
<p>Thanks to Make-A-Wish® Eastern Ontario, her wish came true. During her week- long trip, Khateyanna and her family stayed at Give Kids the World in Florida and visited the many theme parks in the area.</p>
<p>Khateyanna was excited that she got to feed dolphins by hand. In fact there were so many amazing moments on the trip that she took over 700 pictures on her brand new digital camera!</p>
<p>Khateyanna and her family had an amazing time and came back with many wonderful memories. With your support and generosity, we will be able to grant another child’s wish and create new memories for another deserving family.??????</p>
<h3>??????Nicolas’s Wish To have&#8230; a Montreal Canadiens themed room makeover</h3>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-21-at-12.02.39-AM1.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-396 size-medium" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-21-at-12.02.39-AM1-300x223.png" alt="" width="300" height="223" srcset="https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-21-at-12.02.39-AM1-300x223.png 300w, https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-21-at-12.02.39-AM1.png 830w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Nicolas is a passionate young man, particularly where hockey is concerned. The team he loves and is proud to support is the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Nicolas suffers from a severe respiratory condition and a genetic disorder. But Nicolas is a strong and positive boy and he doesn’t let his medical condition affect his passion for hockey and the Habs!</p>
<p>For his wish, Nicolas wanted a room makeover that made it easier for him to move around easily and put his things within reach. With the help of IKEA and their volunteers, Make-A-Wish® Eastern Ontario got to work and completely adapted the room to Nicolas’ needs, while incorporating the theme of his favourite team: the Montreal Canadiens!</p>
<p>Nicolas was overjoyed at the makeover and the extra gifts he received. He and his family told us they were overwhelmed by the whole experience and extremely grateful.<br />

<p>big thank you to all who grew for M4K and contributed to its success. We’ve raised $24,000 for Make-a-Wish EO and its going to go a long way to enriching the lives of the Make-a-Wish children. We had a lot of money still trickling in after the finale on Friday which really added a lot to the bottom line. It was a really great year.</p>
<p>A few thank yous: Trevor Kealey and Mike Hollingworth (co-organizers and co-founders), Paul Townsend (di and co-founder), John Kealey (photographer), Craig McCallion (videographer), Melissa Cowell (tshirt and poster design), <a href="http://capitalprinters.ca">Capital Printers </a>(t-shirt production). Thanks for helping out.</p>
<p>A big thanks to the <a href="../../team/kivuto.1.html">Kivuto team</a>. Together they raised close to $5,000 including a top-up from the company. Looking forward to having them back next year.</p>
<p>And what about the Stache Bash? Well, it was ridiculous but as always &#8211; it was a blast. Great costumes, good fun, lots of laughs.</p>

		<h2><a href="../../index.html%3Fp=357.html" title="Permalink">A mustache is an amazing, amazing thing</a></h2>
		<p>Every year I am absolutely floored by the impact our efforts have on the families we help.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to talk to a parent of a family helped by Make a Wish, you need to watch this.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vu_G3dOnaoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>But what about YOUR mustache? Why is your mustache amazing? Because it granted these 3 wishes&#8230;</strong></p>
<h2>Braden&#8217;s Wish</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-359 size-medium" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/braden1-300x201.png" alt="braden" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/braden1-300x201.png 300w, https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/braden1.png 955w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Braden is a 9-year-old boy from Ottawa that enjoys swimming, watching movies and playing video games. He suffers for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, but he doesn’t let this keep him down! He is known for being quite the conversationalist and loves to talk. Braden was set on either going to Hawaii to see volcanoes, or a home theatre. He quickly decided that he wanted to have a home theatre, so the team at Make-A-Wish got right to work! Braden’s basement was transformed into a full-functioning theatre with comfy chairs, a projector, movie posters, and even a vintage popcorn machine! On wish reveal day, Braden’s father carried him down to the basement and he was shocked! “I think I am going to faint right now!” said Braden.</p>
<h2>Jackson&#8217;s Wish</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-360 size-medium" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jackson1-300x216.png" alt="jackson" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jackson1-300x216.png 300w, https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jackson1.png 766w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Jackson is a 9-year-old boy from Ottawa who absolutely loves the “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see?” book. He also loves spending time with his family. Jackson suffers from Orphan Genetic Disorder, Autism, Epilepsy and is visually impaired. One of his family’s favourite activities is to bike. Jackson is limited physically by his illnesses and is unable to use a normal bicycle, so it was decided that for his wish, he would receive a custom bike from Motion Specialties. For the wish delivery, all of Jackson’s awesome neighbours threw a block party in honour of the big day. When he saw his bike move for the first time, he was so excited that he dropped his copy of Brown Bear, Brown Bear that he is always glued to and focused on the bike. The neighbours organized a group bike ride to celebrate the arrival of Jackson’s new wheels and made him feel like part of the gang. His sister thanked the Make-A-Wish staff for making it possible for her brother to ride alongside her.</p>
<h2>Lucy&#8217;s Wish</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-361 size-medium" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lucy1-199x300.png" alt="lucy" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lucy1-199x300.png 199w, https://m4kottawa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lucy1.png 394w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></p>
<p>Lucy is a 10-year-old girl from Ottawa who suffers from Di George Syndrome, a form of pulmonary hypertension. Her favourite thing in the world is My Little Pony, so when it came time to decide on her wish, there was no doubt that she wanted a My Little Pony party. On wish day, Lucy was totally shocked by what was prepared for her at Rogers House! She was surprised by her family and friends, and even a horse that was done up in pink nail polish and braids! She named the horse Rainbow Dash! There were amazing snacks provided, including a very special My Little Pony cake. Lucy was given countless toys, and her room was made over with My Little Pony posters. Her favourite gift was her Ipad that kept her entertained for hours!</p>

<p>Need a motto? Here it is: Grow a Mustache and raise some cash for kids. It&#8217;s kind of like getting pledges to run a marathon. Without the exertion, cramping, or dehydration.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re getting ready to kick-off this year&#8217;s campaign of Mustaches for Kids. I may have said this before, but this year is going to be awesome. There&#8217;s a lot of buzz &#8211; a lot of buzz. We have a lot of amazing prizes already lined up, a new venue for Stache Bash, amazing tshirts/posters and great new mustache parlay, parables, and portmanteaus.</p>
<p>Above all else, you are making a difference. Last year we raised $21,500. This puts the grand tally just under $150,000. That&#8217;s amazeballs. I&#8217;m going to send out the stories of our wish kids in about a week or so &#8211; something you can share with your supporters.</p>
<p>If you join M4K this year, we promise to never use the word amazeballs again.</p>
<p>What are the dates? November 1st until November 29. Get ready.</p>
<p>From,</p>

		<p>In this final week I ask you to persuade, plea, pry, and pester for pledges. Every little bit helps. The efforts in this last week will probably mean giving another child a life-changing wish. This is the week that actually makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I hope you feel it too.</p>
<p>See you Friday.</p>
